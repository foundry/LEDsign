THIS IS A VERY GOOD SETUP GUIDE from a mac user
http://gettingstartedwithraspberrypi.tumblr.com/

ssh
	sudo apt-get install openssh-server chkconfig
	sudo chkconfig ssh on
	sudo service ssh start	

setting IP address
	http://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration
	if we need a fixed IP
	can assign it in the file
	/etc/network/interfaces

otherwise for dhcp it should look like this
	-----------------
	auto lo eth0
	
	iface lo inet loopback
	iface eth0 inet dhcp
	=================

appletalk
	apt-get install netatalk



VNC
tightvncserver
NB... it will listen on port 590X where X is the tightvnc screen (1,2,3,4...)

autoconf
	apt-get install avahi-daemon avahi-discover libnss-mdns
s
configure for netatalk 
(if you use netatalk  > 2.2.3 you don't have to do this but debian shipped with 2.1.2)
	-----------------
	<?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?><!--*-nxml-*-->
	<!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
	<service-group>
	   <name replace-wildcards="yes">%h</name>
	   <service>
		  <type>_afpovertcp._tcp</type>
		  <port>548</port>
	   </service>
	</service-group> 
	=================

configure for vnc
	-----------------
	http://gettingstartedwithraspberrypi.tumblr.com/
	Run “sudo vi /etc/avahi/services/rfb.service”
	Enter the following: 
	<?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?>
	<!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
	<service-group>
	  <name replace-wildcards="yes">%h</name>
	  <service>
		<type>_rfb._tcp</type>
		<port>5901</port>
	  </service>
	</service-group>
	=================
	
	then
	"sudo /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon restart”

connecting from mac
	in finder go>connect to server
	vnc://pi:raspberry@raspberrypi.local:5901
	IF BONJOUR SET UP ON MACHINE

set pi to autologin and start tightvnc on startup
	http://www.debianadmin.com/how-to-auto-login-and-startx-without-a-display-manager-in-debian.html
	(you don't autostart startx, just tightvnc... an x session starts when you login via vnc)
	1. edit /etc/inittab
	find
	1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1
	comment it out
	#1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1
	replace it with
	1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f [USERNAME] tty1 </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1
	
	in [USERNAME]'s bash_profile add
	tightvncserver :1 -geometry 1024x728 -depth 24
	
wireless
	MicroNEXT MN-WD552B 
	download micronext driver from

   original not-working module in

    all of the files seem to be there but it is not working
    iwconfig brings up nothing
    
    if we try to install drivers supplied by micronext..
    running 'install.sh' ...
    make: *** /lib/modules/3.1.9+/build: No such file or directory.  Stop
    
    the precompiled driver seems to not work:
    pi@raspberrypi:~/led$ sudo depmod
ERROR: failed to load symbols from /lib/modules/3.1.9+/kernel/net/wireless/8192cu.ko: Invalid argument

"If you have blacklisted the original rtl8192 module you have to load the new one
modprobe 8192cu
or add this line

	doesnt work at all
	
	latest attempt from here
	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/80256631/install-rtl8188cus-20120617.sh
	- added the firmware to /usr/local/lib/firmware/
	- copied the SAME driver to two locations
	/lib/modules/3.1.9+/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/
	/lib/modules/3.1.9+/kernel/net/wireless/
	i don't know which one it is using but the drivers are identical
	now it is working... had to reserve an ip for it on the dhcp server...
	but the throughput is terrible (like on squeeze) - eg 1.5Mbits/sec. 
	Should be getting 10-100 times that! I suppose it is enough for ssh-control...

USBMODEM
http://rootprompt.apatsch.net/2012/02/29/huawei-e1552-modem-with-debian-linux/
you need  usb-modeswitch installed sudo to switch it from mass storage to modem use
apt-get install usb-modeswitch (NOT usb_modeswitch)

LAMP
http://fusionstrike.com/2012/setting-ssh-ftp-raspberry-pi-debian
wheezy: trying lighttpd instead apt-get lighttpd
are good for ssh, ftp, php, apache mysql, phpmyadmin

PHPMYADMIN
http://host/phpmyadmin/


=importing database=
mysql> create database texts;
mysql -u root -p texts < test-db.sql


GNOKII (INSTALL MYSQL FIRST!!)
SMS Daemon: http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/419 
apt-get install gnokii 
you MAY need to install these as well
gnokii-cli  gnokii-common 
looks like you WILL have to install these
gnokii-smsd  gnokii-mysql gnokii-smsd-mysql
but they may get all installed with the main one
cf http://packages.debian.org/search?suite=default&section=all&arch=any&searchon=names&keywords=gnokii

the database
/usr/share/doc/gnokii-smsd-mysql/sms.tables.mysql.sql
mysql> create database sms;
mysql -u root -p sms < /usr/share/doc/gnokii-smsd-mysql/sms.tables.mysql.sql

permissions issues
can't access USB unless root
need to add a udev rule to 
- alias the usb device (most likely /dev/ttyUSB0) to /dev/usbmodem
- change permissions on the device to 0666 so we dont need to be root to access it
cd /etc/udev/rules.d
sudo vi z21_persistent-local.rules
ATTRS{product}=="HUAWEI Mobile", MODE="0666", SYMLINK+="usbmodem", GROUP="dialout"
#ATTRS{bInterfaceNumber}=="00"  //first of 3 interfaces eg ttyUSB0 ttyUSB1 ttyUSB2
(in fact we don't need to worry about the interface number, 
it just seems to grab the first off the list and alias it to /dev/usbmodem
this is unreliable... sometimes alias points to sda or other thing...

... after much trial and error could only get this to work reliably
13 KERNEL=="ttyUSB0",MODE="0666"
crw-rw-rwT  1 root dialout 188,   0 Jan  1  1970 ttyUSB0
crw-rw---T  1 root dialout 188,   1 Jan  1  1970 ttyUSB1
crw-rw---T  1 root dialout 188,   2 Jan  1  1970 ttyUSB2


so all we do is change the permissions. 
NOW NOTICED that a symlink 'gsmmodem' is being added (dont know what process is doing that)
so lets use 'gsmmodem' in our conf files...


then this setup (in ~.gnokiirc) works with the TMobile HUAWEI black dongle
 port = /dev/gsmmodem
 model = AT
 connection = serial

ALSO GAMMU
sudo apt-get install gammu
check other gammu bits
sudo apt-cache search GAMMU

gammue conf is /etc/gammurc
also need to conf /etc/gammu-smsdrc

NB - if keyboard is also plugged in then modem access fails/hangs,
regardless of whether we address it as /ttyUSB0 or /gsmmodem

========STARTING AND STOPPING SERVICES AT BOOT========
startup scripts are in /etc/init.d
this is how to stop one...
update-rc.d -f foobar remove
and to start one again...
update-rc.d foobar defaults



========MEASURING THE SPEED OF THE SD CARD=========
pi@raspberrypi:~/led$ sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/null bs=1M count=100

http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=4076&p=54197&hilit=sdhc+card+speed#p54197
SanDisk 4GB Ultra (30MB/s) SDHC Class 6 Memory Card
8gb sandisk Ultra Class 6 (SDHC) "awesome"

 twin pack Sandisk Ultra 8Gb Class 6 cards (that's 2 cards for $26... which I think is a good deal).
 However, this card might be a Costco special. Look at the photo below. It's a Class 6 "Ultra" card but the read speed is 30MB/s!! Normally Ultra is 20MB/s. I also searched the Sandisk site and this card is not listed! Weird.

From what I seen so far from google search's, the best cards are from Sandisk Class 6.

But we have the Extreme and Ultra series.. Don't know whit best…

sandisk extreme sdhc  8gb class 10:
sandisk extreme has the reputation of the only sd card that is suitable for serious server use. if this one doesn't work for raspi i'll definitely yell at someone.

Sandisk 8GB Class 4 SDHC

available in pcworld
4gb ultra class 4 15mb/s 
8gb ultra class 4 15mb/

        
========GAMMU NOTES========
it looks like 
- when a txt msg is received by the stick
- gammu-smsd freezes for around 20 minutes (the log stops)
- THEN it picks up the message and sends it to MYSQL
	- SO now we need to try gnokii-smsd!
	http://wiki.gnokii.org/index.php/SMSD#SMSD
	/usr/sbin/smsd -u root -d sms_gnokii -c localhost -m mysql -b IN -f /var/log/smsdaemon.log
	
	OR... periodically say hourly, on a crontab...
	sudo ./gammu-smsd stop; sudo usb_modeswitch -R -W -v 12d1 -p 1001; sudo ./gammu-smsd start
	(modeswitch resets the usb device... i think...)

how do we ensure the crontab is only operational if gammu-smsd is running??
  - set the crontab in the init.d/gammu-smsd start script
  - remove it in the gammu-smsd stop script
  
  or... the cron script does a test to see if gammu-smsd is running...
  
  
  crontab
  0 * * * * /etc/init.d/gammu-smsd stop; sudo usb_modeswitch -R -W -v 12d1 -p 1001; /etc/init.d/gammu-smsd start
 
 start 
cat /etc/cron.hourly/smsd "
  !# /usr/bin/sh
  if (smsd is running)
    if (ps -e | grep "gammu-smsd")
    echo "restarting gammu...";
    /etc/init.d/gammu-smsd stop; 
    sudo usb_modeswitch -R -W -v 12d1 -p 1001;
    /etc/init.d/gammu-smsd start
  fi"
  
stop
rm /etc/cron.hourly/smsd

============================
----instructions to others

i've been using Debian Wheezy on the pi - (which is what they are now calling Raspbian, i haven't installed the latest version)

my 'live pi' is at http://pi.foundry.tv   (just a single page)

you may be able to log in via ssh (if my firewall is open) as pi / maraberry

if so you will see a version of the feed that gets sent to the led sign... 

try sending it a text on 07903 905708

~/led/smsd.pl is the script that remounts the USB every minute (currently running via a remote ssh session)

/etc/inet.d/gammu-smsd is the startup script for gammu, the software that pulls sms messages off the sim card and adds them to a mysql database.

it's config file is /etc/gammu-smsdrc

/led/led_db_o.pl is the perl script to pull messages from the database and send them to the sign (that's what is running when you log in - it echoes the sign texts to bash)
